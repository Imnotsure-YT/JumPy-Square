# JumPy-Square

I apologize ahead of time for the silly Python pun. 

JumPy-Square is a intro-level turtle project that aims to test the limits of single-threaded libraries. 

It attempts to simulate physics and attempts to reconstruct basic colliders (WIP). 

# Instructions to setup:

Download source, run main.py. No further configuration is needed.
